          Tracing War Themes in a Century of State of the Union Addresses
        </div>
        <div id="writing">
          The State of the Union address is a yearly speech delivered by the
          President of the United States to Congress. It outlines the nation's
          condition and sets forth the legislative agenda. "Echoes of Conflict,"
          maps out the prevalence of war rhetoric in the State of the Union
          addresses over the last century. Through a radial bar chart, each year
          is represented by a bar, with the length indicating what proportion of
          the speech was dedicated to discussing war. The design is
          straightforward: longer bars signal more extensive talk of war, and
          shorter bars, less so.

          This data-driven approach provides a revealing look at how war has
          ebbed and flowed as a subject in the annual addresses to Congress,
          reflecting the nation's entanglement with international and domestic
          conflicts over time. It's also interesting to look at the prevalence
          of war themes when the United States has actually been at war: use the
